Why I kept the classes in this folder in Kraken instead of moving them to CloudPower:

It's not my ambition to create some secret to uploading files in SharePoint. Indeed, these methods are well known.
By offering the file upload utilities as part of the open source project, my hope is that people will find it useful 
and perhaps we'll see a growing community as folks use the library for their own solutions. I have done my best here
to move those classes that add unique business value to LiquidMercury.SharePoint.Client where we can protect them
and improve them, which is what I think really makes this utility competetive. In other words, it is not *that*
we can upload a file to SharePoint, but how we upload files that makes CloudPower so cool.

I would also have moved the metadata upate engine too, but it was so tangled up with teh secret sauce that I think at 
this time we cannot easily do it. Better to keep it proprietary for now and come back later if we can and move it here.
