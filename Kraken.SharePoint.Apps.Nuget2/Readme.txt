Welcome to Kraken.SharePoint.Apps library.

Watch this space in future updates for useful info about how to use this library.

Changes and updates:

v0.1.7: Updated nuget package project; compiling on vs2015; changes to allow for all .net frameworks in single package.
v0.1.?: Removed (non-working) SQL azure server and password from the app.config; Password has been changed so don't bother trying to access it with the older package version. :-P
Sorry, we'll go back to nuget and look over the package history soon to update this log.
