Copying WSP packages to Nuget and other solutions is currently a manual process.

The following target paths can be used in Publish:

R:\Repos\kraken\Kraken.SPFarmLibrary.Nuget2\content\Deploy

Then, rename to either below as needed:
Kraken.SPFarmLibrary.2013.wsp
Kraken.SPFarmLibrary.2010.wsp

For Beowulf packaging, deploy to:

R:\Repos\Beowulf\Deploy14\WSP
R:\Repos\Beowulf\Deploy15\WSP
